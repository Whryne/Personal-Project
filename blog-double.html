                <p class="lead">*Deep Sigh*  I was given the honor of giving a brief speech for Cohort 17's Graduation event.  I am slightly pouty that I have to take time to work on this when I also have to do my personal project, group project AND clean my house in preparation for the out of town guests coming to celebrate with me.  But you know what?  I decided to make the speech a PART of the final project!  That way I'm filling my page with REAL CONTENT as well as free style thinking thrugh some of the topics that I will attempt to cover in my speech.    </p>
                
                <p>If you are(or were) present at YWeb Cohort 17's graduation in December 2022 then please let me know how I did!  I'm honored to be chosen and I intend to do my very best even though I am ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED of public speaking.  In addition to the seventeen other graduates of the Cohort there will also be one or two (in my case THREE!) people in attendance for each person as well as various administrators, well wishers and potential employers!  Somehow in the last forty-nine years of my time on this planet I have managed to avoid any such requirement but this time, we're taking the bull by the horns so here we go!

                <h2>Let's get into some content shall we?</h2>

                <p>Good evening Yweb Cohort17, family, friends and well wishers.  I am Renee Reed and I have been given the task and honor of saying a few words at this years graduation event.  The eighteen folks that we are all here to celebrate have all been working super hard and giving their best since mid-September in order to learn new skills and further our personal goals.  

                I would be remiss if I did not first thank the organization which has afforded us all this opportunity and supported us on our journey towards success.  From their webpage, "YWCA Madison provides wrap-around services that partner with people as they move towards self-sufficiency. From the infant on Third Street to teens in Restorative Justice, to the displaced homemaker looking for employment, to our eldest resident, YWCA is supporting people throughout their lifetime. YWCA takes a holistic approach to help people by addressing the root causes of poverty such as homelessness, unemployment/underemployment, and racism."  The first YWeb Cohort was launched in 2014 and in 2020  the YWCA Madison was fortunate to  receive a grant in collaboration with YWCA USA to expand YWCA Madison’s signature program, YWeb Career Academy, nationwide.

                As part of YWCA Madison’s ongoing mission to eliminate racism and empower women, the YWeb Career Academy program provides education in digital skills to traditionally underserved or vulnerable populations, such as low-wage workers and survivors of domestic violence. The program’s target population is women and people of color. YWCA Madison couples this programming with wrap-around and barrier-reduction services such as child care, stipends, rent assistance, transportation, case management, and job coaching and placement to ensure each participant’s success.

                Now that I've given you the technical and 'professional' description of this program, I'd like to begin to put faces behind the words.  These fierce folks are the ones who put the actual plan into action and saw to it that we graduates had the best chance for success.  The first person that I'd like to acknowledge is Vanessa McDowell, the CEO of the YWCA Madison.  Unfortunately, my personal interactons with this amazing woman have been limited but I see the work that she has accomplished within this organization and the impact that her leadership has had on the environment and temperment of this non-profit.  I also get a certain swell of joy and pride when I see the bill board as you drive north on Park Street with Vanessa much much larger than life and the captions "Protect black women".  I can say from experience that I have felt supported, uplifted and protected during my time spent within this organization.


                    
                    
                    
                    
                   I'm sure your children are perfectly fine average basic children <a href="http://#">that anyone would be proud of.</a> another set of sentences afte that link that I'm not sure why it's here.</p>

                <blockquote><p>“YWCA Madison views this opportunity as a critical investment in communities of color and women in building family sustaining careers, building wealth, and diversifying the tech industry. We have successfully administered YWeb Career Academy since 2014 here in Madison, and it is an honor to expand it more broadly,” said Vanessa McDowell, YWCA Madison, CEO.</p></blockquote>

                <p>I'm sure you're thinking "Wow, this woman is really full of herself!  She has the audacity to think that her children are better humans than evey other human ever born ever!  I mean has she heard of (literally any person who did a famous and also awesome thing ever)?"  Well to that I say "Nanny, nanny boo boo.  Stick your head in poo-poo."  You will never be able to convince me that any other person who ever stood on this planet or any other is better than the people that came directly from my own womb.  My people are morally, ethically, physically, mentally, emotionally, celestially and factually the most awesome humans to ever draw a breath of air.  Every other person that came before was there to prepare the way for them.  Everyone after is there to tell the others of the greatness that happened for their duration on this celestial plane.</p>

                <h3>I also have grandchildren</h3>

                <p>We do understand that my children are in fact the most awesome people to ever grace this universe.  However we must leave room for the fact that true greatness can only be expected to bring forth even greater greatness.  Below is a piece of code that will do a cool thing.  I didn't write this code.  It was given to me in a spiritual state while I communed within the joy of the beauty which are my very own children whom I worship and adore.  If you figure out what it does feel free to hit me up on my blog because I just can't get myself to plug it in somewhere and possibly create skynet.  That's just not my destiny.

<pre><code>
code {
            #include<simplecpp> 
            main_program{ 
            initCanvas(); 
            int start=getClick();float x=1,y=0,h=0.01; 
            Circle c1(start/65536,start%65536,1); 
            repeat(287){ 
            c1.move(x,y);c1.imprint(); 
            y=-1+h;x=x-.007;h=h+.01;} 
            x=1,y=0,h=0.01; 
            Circle c2(start/65536,start%65536,1); 
            repeat(287){ 
            c2.move(-x,y);c2.imprint(); 
            =-1+h;x=x-.007;h=h+.01;} wait(15);} 
}
</code></pre>

                <p>This is a paragraph written inside of a paragraph bracket.  I'm writing this here because I want to remind my self why I have written this here which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do when one is writing a thing in a certain place.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The funny thing is that this part is a list.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first thing I would put on a list is not the last thing..</li>
                            <li>The next thing I would put on a list would be between the first and last.</li>
                            <li>The last thing on the list might just be the most important.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If you look at the code you will see that the above list...</li>
                    <li>is in fact in side of another list.  I'm super impressed.  You should be too.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In conclusion, I hope that you have learned a lot about my babies.  They are no longer biogologically babies but in the spiritual, emotional and metaphysical reality of the sense of the word they are now and will forever be my babies.  My adoration for them will never end and their greatness shall be known through out the realms but current and future and possibly reaching into the past as technological advances allow.</p>
