                <p class="lead">Ya'll done really messed up now.  You done messed around and asked me about my babies!  Okay maybe you didn't ask me.  You probably were just like "Oh cool.  Let me click on this link" but what I heard was "Mama Ne!  Why don't you tell us all about the four lights of your life.  The quads of inspiration.  Your pillars of stability and life unto which your greatest joy is known!"  You can see how any reasonably sane person would make the same mistake.  So here we are ready to talk about my children.  In a blog.   Because this is part of my final project and also my children are the best humans in the world (I'm looking right at you if you think that your children or anyone else in the entire existence of humanity is better than my babies.)  </p>
                
                <p>I may not have been the best mother but I somehow still managed to turn out the world's best children.  The humans that I had the privilege of growing inside me and then growing up alongside of are warm, wonderful, strange, beautiful and magical beings.  They all look like mirror versions of one another and the overlapping personality archetypes are enough to make any doubting thomas curious about the statistical probability of such an occurrence.  One thing bout me though?  I don't play about these folks here!
                </p>

                <h2>Don't You Wish Your Progeny Were as Amazing As Mine?</h2>

                <p>I'm sure you do.  But truly, you must not blame yourself that you were not blessed to parent one of these amazing children.  I'm sure your children are perfectly fine average basic children <a href="http://#">that anyone would be proud of.</a> The fact that the children that I gave birth to are clearly superior in every way possible to be measured is absolutely no reflection on you or your parenting skills.  Or the environment that you chose to raise them in.  Or the food that you chose to give them.  The only thing that is important is that you did your best, at least most of the time.</p>

                <blockquote><p>The fact that the children that I gave birth to are clearly superior in every way possible to be measured is absolutely no reflection on you or your parenting skills.</p></blockquote>

                <p>I'm sure you're thinking "Wow, this woman is really full of herself!  She has the audacity to think that her children are better humans than evey other human ever born ever!  I mean has she heard of (literally any person who did a famous and also awesome thing ever)?"  Well to that I say "Nanny, nanny boo boo.  Stick your head in poo-poo."  You will never be able to convince me that any other person who ever stood on this planet or any other is better than the people that came directly from my own womb.  My people are morally, ethically, physically, mentally, emotionally, celestially and factually the most awesome humans to ever draw a breath of air.  Every other person that came before was there to prepare the way for them.  Everyone after is there to tell the others of the greatness that happened for their duration on this celestial plane.</p>

                <h3>I also have grandchildren</h3>

                <p>We do understand that my children are in fact the most awesome people to ever grace this universe.  However we must leave room for the fact that true greatness can only be expected to bring forth even greater greatness.  Below is a piece of code that will do a cool thing.  I didn't write this code.  It was given to me in a spiritual state while I communed within the joy of the beauty which are my very own children whom I worship and adore.  If you figure out what it does feel free to hit me up on my blog because I just can't get myself to plug it in somewhere and possibly create skynet.  That's just not my destiny.

<pre><code>
code {
            #include<simplecpp> 
            main_program{ 
            initCanvas(); 
            int start=getClick();float x=1,y=0,h=0.01; 
            Circle c1(start/65536,start%65536,1); 
            repeat(287){ 
            c1.move(x,y);c1.imprint(); 
            y=-1+h;x=x-.007;h=h+.01;} 
            x=1,y=0,h=0.01; 
            Circle c2(start/65536,start%65536,1); 
            repeat(287){ 
            c2.move(-x,y);c2.imprint(); 
            =-1+h;x=x-.007;h=h+.01;} wait(15);} 
}
</code></pre>

                <p>This is a paragraph written inside of a paragraph bracket.  I'm writing this here because I want to remind my self why I have written this here which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do when one is writing a thing in a certain place.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The funny thing is that this part is a list.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first thing I would put on a list is not the last thing..</li>
                            <li>The next thing I would put on a list would be between the first and last.</li>
                            <li>The last thing on the list might just be the most important.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If you look at the code you will see that the above list...</li>
                    <li>is in fact in side of another list.  I'm super impressed.  You should be too.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In conclusion, I hope that you have learned a lot about my babies.  They are no longer biogologically babies but in the spiritual, emotional and metaphysical reality of the sense of the word they are now and will forever be my babies.  My adoration for them will never end and their greatness shall be known through out the realms but current and future and possibly reaching into the past as technological advances allow.</p>
